# Flask + MongoDB project template

Get started with a new Flask project, powered by MongoDB, on [SourceLair](https://www.sourcelair.com/home).

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is by visiting http://lair.io/stacks/flask-mongo and starting a new SourceLair project with a single click.

This will do the following on your behalf:

1. create a new SourceLair project for your Flask + MongoDB app
2. clone the code from this Git repository
3. install your pip dependencies (`pip intall -r requirements.txt`)
4. start a Flask server (`python server.py`) serving your project and expose it to your public URL

## Connecting to the databse

If you'd like to connect to your database, just type `mongo --host mongo`

### Database credentials

- host: `mongo`

### Is my data safe?

Of course it is, SourceLair databases are only available from within your project.

## Tips

- edit your files using SourceLair's fully-featured editor
- run commands (e.g. `pip freeze`) in SourceLair's Linux terminal
- view and test your Flask app using your public URL (click on the _eye_ icon in the sidebar)
- in case you need any help contact SourceLair using the _envelope_ icon in the sidebar or send an email to [support@sourcelair.com](mailto:support@sourcelair.com)
